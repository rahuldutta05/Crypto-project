## 📖 The Philosophy

Traditional secure messaging asks you to **trust the server**. CryptoChat v2 eliminates trust as a requirement entirely.

| Old Claim | New Proof |
|-----------|-----------|
| *"We don't log who you are"* | **Ring Signature** — provably unlinkable sender |
| *"This message existed at time T"* | **Merkle Proof** — mathematically verifiable |
| *"We deleted the encryption key"* | **Proof of Deletion** — cryptographically demonstrated |
| *"Past messages are safe if we're hacked"* | **Double Ratchet** — forward secrecy by construction |

Every claim is a **mathematical proof**. No faith in any party required.

## 🏛️ Three Cryptographic Pillars

### 🔵 Pillar 1 — The Phantom Sender *(Anonymous Authentication)*

> *"We don't just hide your identity. We give you 4 innocent alibis."*

**Ring Signatures** — When a message is sent, the signature mathematically proves it came from *one of N registered users* — but it is impossible, even for the server, to determine which one. The sender is hidden inside a crowd. This is the same primitive used by **Monero**, the privacy cryptocurrency.

**Blind Signatures (Chaum's Scheme)** — Like signing a document inside a carbon-paper envelope. The server signs your authentication token *without ever seeing it*. You later reveal the token; the server can verify it's genuine but has **zero record** of having issued it to you specifically. This is how anonymous e-cash works.

**Zero-Knowledge Device Pairing** — No username. No password. No phone number. Two devices exchange keys via Diffie-Hellman over QR code or a 6-digit code. Both parties compute a **Safety Number** (Signal-style) — a short fingerprint you compare verbally to detect any man-in-the-middle.

---

### 🟣 Pillar 2 — The Witness Protocol *(Verifiable Data Existence)*

> *"A proof the size of a tweet, covering a database of millions."*

**Merkle Proof Trees** — Every message becomes a leaf in a Merkle tree. Only the 32-byte root hash is published. Any single message can be proven to have existed at time T using a tiny Merkle path — without revealing any other message in the tree. This is exactly how **Bitcoin transaction proofs** work.

```
         RootHash
        /         \
    H(A+B)        H(C+D)
    /    \        /    \
  H(A)  H(B)  H(C)  H(D)
```

**Commitment Schemes with Reveal** — Before sending, a commitment (hash of message + random salt) is published. The message is revealed later. Anyone can verify you didn't retroactively change it. **Temporal integrity**: you said what you said, when you said it.

**Proof-of-Existence** — The backend never stores message content — only a SHA-256 chain hash and a timestamp. The existence of a conversation is verifiable; its contents are not accessible to anyone but the participants.

---

### 🔴 Pillar 3 — Cryptographic Amnesia *(Enforced Data Expiry)*

> *"We don't just forget. We make it mathematically impossible to remember."*

**Signal Double Ratchet** — Every single message gets a fresh derived key via **HKDF-SHA-256**. Once you advance the ratchet, the old key is not just deleted — it is *underivable*. Even if an attacker records all network traffic today and steals your device tomorrow, every past message is provably unreadable. Implemented in full on both the Python backend and the React frontend (WebCrypto API).

**Time-Lock Cipher** — Messages are encrypted with keys that carry an expiry timestamp. A background scheduler (APScheduler) checks every 60 seconds and **nullifies** expired keys — setting them to `null` in storage. Recovery after expiry is not a policy decision; it is a mathematical impossibility.

**Proof of Deletion** — The most provocative primitive: *Can you prove you deleted something?* Using a commitment scheme, a key's existence is committed to at creation. Upon expiry, an HMAC-signed attestation is published that proves: *"I held this key, and I have now overwritten it with zeros."* No trust required — the proof is publicly verifiable.

**Burn on Read** — A message can be flagged to self-destruct immediately upon delivery. The recipient's client emits `destroy_message` over WebSocket; the server nullifies the proof hash and notifies both parties.

## 🔬 Cryptographic Primitives Deep Dive

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Uses **RFC 3526 2048-bit MODP Group 14** (the same well-known safe prime used by SSH and TLS). Private keys are 256-bit random integers. Session keys are derived from the shared secret using **PBKDF2-SHA256** with 100,000 iterations and a random 32-byte salt — ensuring both sides arrive at the identical AES-256 key.

### Double Ratchet (Signal Protocol)
```
SharedSecret ──HKDF──► SendChain   RecvChain
                           │              │
              Step 1:  HKDF(SendChain) → MsgKey₁ + NewSendChain
              Step 2:  HKDF(NewSendChain) → MsgKey₂ + ...
```
Every message advances the chain. `MsgKeyN` encrypts exactly one message with AES-256-GCM, then is discarded. The previous chain state is gone — it cannot be recomputed from the new state. Fully implemented in Python (backend) and JavaScript WebCrypto API (frontend) with matching HKDF parameters.

### Ring Signatures
```
Ring = {User₁, User₂, User₃, User₄, User₅}
Signer = User₃ (unknown to verifier)

Verify(Ring, Message, Signature) → TRUE
Who signed? → MATHEMATICALLY UNKNOWABLE
```
The implementation uses a shared-modulus RSA construction. The verifier can confirm the signature is valid for the ring, but the signer's index is computationally hidden.

### Merkle Tree
```
New message arrives → SHA-256(proof_hash) → appended as leaf
Tree rebuilt → new root_hash stored
Any message can be proven with O(log n) hashes
Root hash published — proving all messages without revealing any
```

### Blind Signatures (Chaum)
```
Client:  m' = H(token) * r^e mod n    (blind with random r)
Server:  s' = (m')^d mod n            (sign without seeing token)
Client:  s  = s' * r⁻¹ mod n         (unblind — now has valid sig on token)
Verify:  s^e mod n == H(token)        ✓ — but server has no record of r
```

## 🛡️ Security Dashboard

The admin dashboard at `/admin` provides:

- **Threat Level Banner** — AUTO/ELEVATED/HIGH/CRITICAL based on recent event density
- **Attack Type Breakdown** — bar chart of replay attacks, brute force, MITM, unauthorized access, timing anomalies
- **Core Principles Status** — live counters for anonymous devices, proofs created, keys destroyed
- **Recent Security Events** — scrollable table with timestamp, type, severity, details
- **Attacker Simulation Panel** — fire test events to verify the monitoring pipeline
- **Penetration Test Report** — auto-generated security strengths and vulnerability list
- **Export** — download all events as JSON or CSV for external analysis

---

## 🧪 Running the Pentest Simulation

The project includes an **automated attack script** (`attack.py`) designed for live demonstrations. 

1. **Dashboard**: Open **http://localhost:5173/admin**
2. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   python attack.py
   ```
3. **Defense Scenarios**:
   - 🔁 **Replay Protection** — Attacker tries to resend captured messages.
   - 💥 **Brute Force Detection** — Rapid failures trigger automated detectors.
   - 🕵 **MITM Defeat** — System detects Signal-style fingerprint mismatches.
   - 🚫 **Unauthorized Rejection** — Rejects unauthenticated private data requests.
   - 📈 **Threat Level Sensor** — Watch the "Threat Level" turn **RED (CRITICAL)** as attacks intensify.
